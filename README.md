# Fish-Classification
Fish classify based on Real-ESRGAN under fuzzy environment
## Datasets
Our classification data used "Fish4Knowlege", all of files that has connection with our method had been put on the "datasets" folder, except original data images and processed data images because of size, if you need these images, please contact with me by email: 18075153959@163.com
## Model
To test wether high resolution images processed by Real-ESRGAN could rise the accuracy of fish classification task, I select some classic CNN and slight CNN, all of them has a folder named by their own name. Data preprocess code, model code and training code were put in the folder.

**Attention: some path need to change by your own path**
